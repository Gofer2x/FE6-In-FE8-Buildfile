## WM_IntroScroll
Man and Dragon once coexisted in[N]
harmony. However, Man shattered [N]
that harmony with a sudden onslaught.[N]
A great war now known as The Scouring[N]
was fought for dominion of the land.[N]
Losses were tremendous for both sides[N]
and this war rattled the very[N]
foundations of the continent on[N]
which they battled...[N]
Defeated and humbled, the Dragons[N]
disappeared from the realm.[N]
Mankind then began to rebuild and [N]
repopulate their newly won land.[N]
A millennium has passed since then...[N]

## WM_IntroIdk1
The Scouring...[N]
The great war between dragons and men...[AN][X]

## WM_IntroIdk2
The dragons were defeated[N]
and disappeared from Elibe...[AN][X]

## WM_IntroIdk3
Mankind celebrated victory and then[N]
spread their forces throughout the continent...[AN][X]

## WM_IntroIdk4
1000 years have passed...[AN][X]



## WM_Intro1
After defeating the dragons,[N]
the humans of Elibe quickly spread their[AN]
culture and civilization to the farthest[N]
reaches of the continent.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro2
In the west lies the Kingdom of[N]
Etruria, which is widely considered to[AN]
possess the most refined culture[N]
in all of Elibe.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro3
The Kingdom of Bern, with its powerful[N]
military and logical, pragmatic people,[AN]
is located on the other side of[N]
the continent in the east.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro4
These are the two most powerful nations[N]
in Elibe with the weaker nations[AN]
situated between them.[N]
These smaller lands are...[AN][X]

## WM_Intro5
the Lycian League, whose numerous[N]
territories are independently ruled[AN]
by a number of marquesses that are [N]
bound by a vow of allegianceア[AN][X]

## WM_Intro6
Ilia, where the people arduously[N]
till the frozen soil and many[AN]
become mercenaries to earn[N]
money to surviveア[AN][X]

## WM_Intro7
and Sacae, where various clans ride[N]
through the plains on horseback.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro8
Although there were occasional clashes[N]
between these nations, the majority[AN]
of the people of Elibe lived in peace.[N]
That peace, however, was not to last...[AN][X]

## WMChWM_Intro9
King Zephiel of Bern has commanded his[N]
forces to conquer the entirety of Elibe.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro10
Bern's armies first attacked Sacae and Ilia,[N]
ruthlessly massacring all who opposed them.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Now, Bern is mounting a merciless[N]
invasion into Lycia.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro11
Pherae is a territory of Lycia known for[N]
its beauty and honorable lords.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Pherae's Lord Roy was studying in the great[N]
territory of Ostia when the invasion began.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, the sitting marquess and Roy's[N]
father, Eliwood, who has been ill,[AN]
has sent for Roy to return to lead Pherae's[N]
soldiers in defending against Bern.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro12
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Marquess Hector of Ostia is Eliwood's[N]
long-time friend and confidant, and leads[AN]
the council of lords in Lycia.[N]
At the time Eliwood sent for Roy,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Marquess Ostia's daughter Lilina[N]
was in Pherae visiting Eliwood.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro13
Upon receiving his father's message, Roy[N]
hurries home, taking with him his vassals[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
and Bors, a knight from Ostia who is[N]
responsible for Lilina's safety.[AN][X]

## WM_Intro14
The story begins when Roy reaches[N]
the outskirts of Pherae...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch2_1
There is a small village on the border[N]
of Pherae and Bern.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
This is where Roy is to meet the[N]
mercenary band that Eliwood hired.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch2_2
Just east of the village is a small castle[N]
occupied by Bern's forces.[AN]
At the time Roy reaches the village,[N]
the castle is in an outright panic.[AN]
Roy has yet to realize that this confusion[N]
going on in the castle will spread,[AN]
engulfing the entire continent of Elibe[N]
in chaos...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch3_1
Just north of Pherae stands[N]
Castle Araphen.[AN]
The armies of Lycia had gathered here to[N]
make preparations to strike back at Bern.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, when Roy and Guinivere are only a[N]
short distance from Castle Araphen,[AN]
a messenger brings them shocking[N]
news they can scarcely believe.[AN]
Leading Bern's army is a trio of elite[N]
commanders known as the Wyvern Generals,[AN]
named after the reptilian creatures native[N]
to Bern for their ferocity and cunning.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch3_2
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Two of these three, Brunnya and[N]
Narcian, have attacked Castle Araphen,[AN]
virtually decimating the Lycian Army[N]
while it was little prepared.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch3_3
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Morale of the group takes a blow, but[N]
Roy continues to Castle Araphen,[AN]
both to see it for himself and, hopefully,[N]
find and aid any survivors...[N]



## WM_Ch4_1
Respecting Hector's dying request,[N]
Roy makes his way west.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Intent on reaching Lilina, Roy[N]
keeps a steady pace toward Ostia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
On his way there, Roy passes through[N]
the territory of Laus,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
governed by Lord Erik.[AN]
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory[N]
with vast meadows and clear streams.[AN]
Beneath this beauty, however, lies[N]
treachery and great skullduggery...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch5_1
Marquess Laus had been working with[N]
Bern against his allies in Lycia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy realizes that the leaders of Lycia, his[N]
homeland, can no longer be trusted.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Still heading for Ostia, Roy moves through[N]
a treacherous mountain pass...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch6_1
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
After taking Saul, a priest of St. Elimine,[N]
and Dorothy, his bodyguard, into their ranks,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy and company enter Thria,[N]
southeast of Ostia.[AN]
Thria is governed by Lord Orun,[N]
Hector's cousin.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch6_2
Orun's home castle seems a safe[N]
place to stay.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch6_3
As such, Roy expects a night of[N]
quiet rest for his troops.[AN]
However, even Thria is within Bern's[N]
influence...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch7_1
Hearing of rebellion, Roy[N]
hurries his pace towards Ostia.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch7_2
[LoadOverworldFaces]
According to his information,[N]
General Legance, an advisor to Hector,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
organized a rebellion with his lieutenant,[N]
Debias, to surrender to Bern.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch7_3
Legance keeps Lilina hostage in Castle[N]
Ostia, thinking she may be of use later.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch7_4
Roy and company enter Ostia in an[N]
effort to rescue Lilina.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch7_5
Ostia, the largest and most populous city[N]
in Lycia, is to become a battlefield...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch8_1
Ostia's military primarily consists of[N]
soldiers in heavy armor.[AN]
With them, Castle Ostia has[N]
always been famously secure.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
For countless years, the castle has[N]
been said to be impregnable.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, the rumors are about to be proven[N]
wrong by Roy, who, ironically,[AN]
only does so for the castle's[N]
own protection...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch8x_1
Roy vowed to protect Lilina.[AN]
With Bern coming full force however,[N]
Roy's army is no equal.[AN]
Therefore, he decides to try and[N]
obtain a legendary weapon.[AN]
He thinks it best to obtain it before[N]
Bern manages to get their hands on it.[AN]
Lilina shows them to a cave[N]
on the outskirts of Ostia,[AN]
where a legendary weapon is hidden.[AN]
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,[N]
will be no small obstacle for Roy...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch9_1
After driving Narcian away from Ostia,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy and company brace themselves for[N]
further attacks from Bern.[AN]
However, Bern's belligerent movements[N]
toward Lycia come to an abrupt halt,[AN]
as if to mock Roy and his caution.[AN]
Bern also remains unresponsive[N]
to a treaty offer from Etruria.[AN]
Bern's sudden silence and lack of[N]
activity can only be described as eerie.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch9_2
With Hector gone, Pherae is now the[N]
greatest power in Lycia.[AN]
Eliwood summons the council of marquesses[N]
to Pherae to discuss future actions.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
It is decided that Eliwood is to lead[N]
the council of the Lycian League.[AN]
A new Lycian Army is also to[N]
be established.[AN]
This new army's purpose is not to[N]
take the offensive against Bern,[AN]
but rather take a defensive[N]
stance for Lycia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Owing to his victory against Bern in Ostia,[N]
Roy is chosen leader of this new army.[AN]
Gradually, the attitude and morale in[N]
Lycia begins to improve.[AN]
People once again conduct business without[N]
fear, and they embrace a new optimism.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch9_3
At this time, Etruria calls for Lycia's[N]
assistance.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The kingdom needs help with restoring[N]
law to the Western Isles.[AN]
Many outlaws make their bases there,[N]
and anarchy is said to rule.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch9_4
Many in Lycia are uneager to send their[N]
troops to the Isles to deal with bandits,[AN]
but having received Etruria's aid in Ostia,[N]
they have no choice but to oblige.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Thus, Roy and the Lycian Army pass[N]
through Etruria toward the Isles.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch9_5
The Western Isles are the numerous[N]
islands off the western coast of Elibe.[AN]
Presently, they are colonies of Etruria.[AN]
The Western Isles are rich in resources,[N]
so mining is a major industry here.[AN]
However, these resources are[N]
worth a fortune.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Inevitably, varied bands of rogues traveled[N]
there hoping to loot the mines.[AN]
As such, the people of the Western Isles[N]
live in constant fear of bandit attacks.[AN]
Roy is sent to vanquish these bandits...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch10A_1
Three separate islands:[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Fibernia,[AN][X]

## WM_Ch10A_2
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Caldonia,[AN][X]

## WM_Ch10A_3
[LoadOverworldFaces]
and Dia.[AN]
All of these islands are rich in minerals,[N]
and mining is the economic backbone.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The largest mine is located in[N]
Eburacum, in north Fibernia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy leads his forces toward Eburacum[N]
hoping to learn more about the bandits.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch10A_4
To get to Eburacum, one must pass a[N]
castle located nearby.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy sends a messenger to Sir Nord,[N]
lord of the castle,[AN]
to request permission to[N]
pass through his lands.[AN]
Because Roy and company are in[N]
the Isles on Etruria's request,[AN]
they don't anticipate trouble in[N]
gaining Nord's support.[AN]
But not everything is as[N]
simple as it appears...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch11A_1
Roy can hardly believe Larum's account.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
He quickly pens a letter to Cecilia to let[N]
her know of the horrors on the Isles.[AN]
He also tells her of the actions he[N]
plans to take from this point.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
After sending the letter, Roy moves[N]
towards the Eburacum mine.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch11A_2
His goal is to rescue the people[N]
suffering from forced labor.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Etruria has assigned Bishop Orlo of the[N]
St. Elimine Church to supervise the mine.[AN]
It was already a fruitful endeavor, but[N]
the nobles' greed is unsatiable.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch11A_3
Eburacum... Known now as the Mine of Death.[AN]
The wails of the people forced into[N]
labor echo through the mines,[AN]
like the howling of ghosts,[N]
never sleeping...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch10B_1
[LoadOverworldFaces]
In order to speak to the resistance[N]
force about the bandits on the Isles,[AN]
Roy and company move west along[N]
the coastline.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch10B_2
Along the way, they come across[N]
a small village caught in conflict.[AN]
The local lord oppresses the resistance and[N]
does anything he can to get rid of them...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch11B_1
The Lycian Army takes Elffin in[N]
as an advisor.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Following his advice, they move south[N]
toward the isle of Caldonia.[AN]
Caldonia is one of the main islands[N]
that make up the Western Isles,[AN]
the other two being Fibernia and Dia.[AN][LoadOverworldFaces][X]

## WM_Ch11B_2
Castle Eidyna is located on Caldonia. Here,[N]
men from all over the Isles are imprisoned,[AN]
awaiting transport to Eburacum,[N]
the Mine of Death.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch11B_3
When Roy arrives at Castle Eidyna,[N]
the situation appears dire...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch12_1
To liberate the people of the Western Isles,[N]
Roy heads for Juteaux,[AN]
the Isles' largest city and its capital.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch12_2
According to Elffin, Lord Arcardo, who is[N]
in charge of overseeing the Western Isles,[AN]
is an Etrurian of high nobility but of little[N]
prominence in the Etrurian court.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch12_3
Roy, still wary of how Etruria may[N]
respond to his attack,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
prepares his soldiers to rid the Isles[N]
of Arcardo to rescue the people...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch12x_1
Following Elffin's guidance,[AN]
Roy heads for a cave near Juteaux[N]
to obtain a legendary weapon.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch12x_2
But Roy and company aren't the[N]
only ones who know of the cave.[AN]
Yet another battle awaits them...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch13_1
The chaos caused by the coup in Aquileia[N]
quickly spreads to the rest of Etruria.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch13_2
Cecilia escapes with Guinivere[N]
from Aquileia.[AN]
She also forms a loyalist group to[N]
combat the revolutionaries.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The revolutionaries, however,[N]
have Bern on their side.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
King Mordred has also been taken hostage,[N]
giving the revolutionaries another edge:[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Great General Douglas and Knight General [N]
Perceval are forced into their service.[AN]
With so much power, the revolutionaries[N]
easily push the loyalists out of Etruria.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch13_3
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The loyalists are driven into an old[N]
castle on the Missur Peninsula.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch13_4
Roy learns that Cecilia has been[N]
forced back by the revolutionaries.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch13_5
In response, Roy heads for Missur.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch13_6
The loyalists are under attack by both[N]
revolutionaries and Bern's military.[AN]
With such adversity, the loyalists'[N]
forces have little time...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch14_1
After Roy rescues Cecilia,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
he obliges Sophia's request and[N]
heads into the Nabata desert.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch14_2
According to Sophia, her village,[N]
Arcadia, is located in a hidden oasis.[AN]
The village is under attack by Bern,[AN]
and Roy believes their aim to be the[N]
dragons said to inhabit the village.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch14_3
The Lycian Army moves quickly to Arcadia,[N]
but a sandstorm impedes their progress...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch14x_1
In the hidden village of Arcadia[N]
stands an ancient temple.[AN]
One of the legendary weapons[N]
is said to be hidden within.[AN]
Roy and company are hot on the[N]
trail of Bern's troops,[AN]
who have already made their[N]
way into the temple...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch15_1
After saving the village of Arcadia,[AN]
Roy's army leaves the desert by[N]
following Igrene's lead.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Now, they turn toward Etruria to confront[N]
the revolutionary forces.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch15_2
However, they receive a troubling[N]
letter from the elder of Arcadia.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch15_3
Apparently, Fae the dragon has[N]
left Arcadia in pursuit of Roy.[AN]
If she falls into the hands of the[N]
revolutionaries or Bern,[AN]
there is no telling what might[N]
happen to her, or to Roy's army.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch15_4
Determined to find Fae, Roy moves to[N]
a small fort on the Etrurian border...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch16_1
[LoadOverworldFaces]
After rescuing Fae,[N]
Roy heads for Aquileia.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch16_2
The capital of Etruria,[AN]
Aquileia is also the largest and[N]
wealthiest city on the continent.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Prepared for the Lycian Army's attack,[AN]
the revolutionary forces are[N]
fortified in Aquileia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The St. Elimine Church supports the Lycian[N]
Army, turning popular opinion against[AN]
the revolutionaries, forcing them[N]
inside the castle.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch16_3
The St. Elimine Church was founded by Saint[N]
Elimine, one of the Eight Legends.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The church has legions of followers,[N]
particularly in Bern and Etruria.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy's attack on Aquileia is[N]
supported by the church.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, Narcian and his elite troops[N]
await Roy inside the castle...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch16x_1
At the request of King Mordred, Roy heads[N]
for the Saint's Tower outside Aquileia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The Saint's Tower was once a place of[N]
worship for Saint Elimine.[AN]
In the tower lay numerous sacred relics[N]
relating to her.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, this sacred tower is now[N]
under the control of the revolutionaries.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Bishop Windham now occupies the tower after[N]
betraying the St. Elimine Church...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch17A_1
After Roy captures Aquileia, other[N]
Etrurian forces flock to the loyalists,[AN]
forcing out the revolutionaries.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roartz and Arcardo are driven out of[N]
Etruria.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
They flee north to Ilia,[N]
which is under Bern's control.[AN]
Ilia, the frozen highlands, is a[N]
land with short summers and long winters.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17A_2
With so little arable land,[AN]
the nation's main source of[N]
income is mercenary contracts.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17A_3
The now free Kingdom of Etruria[N]
joins forces with the Lycian Army.[AN]
Now a joint force under the name of the[N]
Etrurian Army,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
their first mission is to enter Ilia[N]
and finish off the revolutionaries.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
After that, they plan to launch a[N]
direct attack on Bern.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy, nominated as leader of[N]
the Etrurian Army,[AN]
has the powerful support of[N]
the St. Elimine Church.[AN]
With the church's support comes[N]
also the support of the people.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17A_4
However, Roy has to face not only[N]
the freezing cold of Ilia,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
but also the elite troops under[N]
Murdock, head of Bern's Wyvern Generals.[AN]
Even worse, many skilled mercenary[N]
knights of Ilia have sided with Bern.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
To begin, Roy heads for Castle Remi,[N]
located on the Ilian border...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch18A_1
After defeating Arcardo, Roy moves[N]
east, deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
He soon enters the thick forests[N]
that characterize central Ilia.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, a commander of Bern,[N]
Bishop Martel, lies in wait.[AN]
In his possession is an ancient spell[N]
said to have been lost centuries ago...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch19A_1
After defeating Martel and making it[N]
through the woodlands,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy and company face the blizzards[N]
common of Ilia's winters.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Ilia's harsh weather has in the past served[N]
as a natural defense against invaders.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
In this blizzard, Sigune, captain of a[N]
pegasus knight squad working for Bern,[AN]
makes preparations to attack[N]
Roy and his troops...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch20A_1
After defeating Sigune,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy heads for Edessa,[N]
located in the northeast of Ilia.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch20A_2
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Castle Edessa, home of Zelot, leader of[N]
the Ilian mercenary knights,[AN]
once served as headquarters of the[N]
pegasus knight mercenaries as well.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, with Zelot's absence, Bern saw[N]
its chance and attacked the castle,[AN]
forcing the mercenaries and pegasus[N]
knights into submission.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Murdock had made the castle his base,[N]
but after he returned to Bern,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
High Chancellor Roartz was put in charge.[AN]
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's[N]
speedy advance to Edessa,[AN]
Roartz hurriedly contacts the various[N]
Ilian mercenary groups for aid.[AN]
Unfortunately for him, however,[N]
their replies are not promising...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch20Ax_1
After taking back Castle Edessa,[AN]
Roy turns his troops toward the ancient[N]
ruins on the outskirts of the town.[AN]
A legendary weapon is said to be[N]
hidden within...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch17B_1
After Roy captures Aquileia, powers[N]
in Etruria turn against the revolution.[AN]
Driven away from the palace,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roartz and Arcardo flee to Sacae,[N]
which remains under Bern's control.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17B_2
Sacae lies in the center of the[N]
continent and is covered in plains.[AN]
Before Bern's invasion, it was[N]
home to numerous nomadic clans.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17B_3
The Etrurian Army joins the Lycian[N]
Army to form a unified force.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The decision is made for this army[N]
to head for Sacae with dual purpose.[AN]
The first is to eliminate the remnants[N]
of the revolution,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
and the second is to begin an[N]
offensive against Bern.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Realizing that Etrurian soldiers may[N]
not fight under the Lycian banner,[AN]
Roy formally decides to call his[N]
force the Etrurian Army.[AN]
Roy is to lead the division that[N]
will begin the offensive in Sacae.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch17B_4
The people of Sacae are wary of[N]
outsiders, which is challenge enough,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
but Brunnya, one of Bern's[N]
three Wyvern Generals,[AN]
has the Djute, the largest clan in[N]
Sacae, under her control.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
With the warriors of the Djute and[N]
Brunnya's elite troops in his way,[AN]
Roy knows it is unlikely he will find[N]
any respite in this foreign land...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch18B_1
After defeating Arcardo,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy crosses the border and[N]
enters the land of Sacae.[AN]
The Djute, the most powerful clan in[N]
Sacae, serve Bern unbendingly.[AN]
All clans who have stood against these[N]
two joint forces have faced decimation.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
The chieftain of the Kutolah clan,[N]
the famed Silver Wolf Dayan,[AN]
does lead a guerrilla resistance,[N]
but to disappointingly little effect.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
With none to oppose them, Bern essentially[N]
has full control over Sacae.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
As Roy sets foot on the plains,[N]
the Djute wait to strike...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch19B_1
After defeating the Djute,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy moves toward Bulgar,[N]
the largest city in Sacae.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch19B_2
As a center of commerce between[N]
Etruria, Bern and Ilia,[AN]
Bulgar has a history of being a[N]
free city without rule.[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
However, High Chancellor Roartz now holds[N]
control of Bulgar with Bern's support.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch19B_3
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy enters Bulgar with the hopes of[N]
liberating it and learning more...[AN][X]



## WM_Ch20B_1
After Roy meets Niime the Hermit,[N]
some light is shed on Bern's dragons.[AN]
With many questions still left[N]
unanswered,[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy directs his troops towards a large[N]
manor on the edge of Bulgar.[AN][X]

## WM_Ch20B_2
Here, High Chancellor Roartz prepares[N]
