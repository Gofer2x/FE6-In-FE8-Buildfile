classes classes. for some reasno the classes table breaks and gives units weird amounts of avoid and breaks battle animations. look into that

actually do class stats moving lol

once classes moved update effectiveness groups and items that use them for them (binding blade and divinestone)

and skillsys tables and all that jazz

since triangle attacks now use something else remove their hardcoding?
